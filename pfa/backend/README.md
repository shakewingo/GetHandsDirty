cursor使用感受：新任务正确率很高，token长了以后后面容易越改越乱；最新3.5和hauki同样prompt差距蛮大的

1. codebase太牛了, help me can all codes and debug example说一下
2. explain structure：
NavigationView
└── ScrollView (main, vertical)
    └── VStack (main container)
        ├── VStack (summary section)
        │   ├── HStack (Total Assets & Credits)
        │   └── ValueItem (Net Assets)
        │
        ├── VStack (assets section)
        │   └── LazyVStack (asset groups)
        │       └── ScrollView (individual asset details when expanded)
        │
        └── VStack (credits section)
            └── LazyVStack (credit groups)
                └── ScrollView (individual credit details when expanded)
3. checkpoint feature is great!! No need to worry about revert
4. swipe action cannot be executed, so ask to redesign UI
5. walkthough how LLM helps me publish app - answer product server url questions etc.
